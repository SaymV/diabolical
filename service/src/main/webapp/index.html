    <h1>Welcome to Diabolical!</h1>

    <p>Things are still quite preliminary.  Just to show that there is something here:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Despite the error message, <a href="items">/items</a> demonstrates the
        JAX-RS resource layer that is running underneath.</li>

        <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/SaymV/diabolical">GitHub repository</a>
        shows what has been done so far.  The <code>master</code> branch shows the original
        stack; the <code>gae</code> branch shows what has been ported to GAE (this app!).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The class may have ended but the work goes on...</p>
